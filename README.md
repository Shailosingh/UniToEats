# UniToEats

## Introduction
UniToEats is a customizable mobile application prototype that allows educational institutions to list on-site restaurants for students to order from remotely.

### Purpose
Students are busy individuals, and many do not consume the recommended amount of nutrients. Despite having food options nearby, long lines discourage students from ordering, as they may be between classes, rushing to work or need the extra time to study or unwind. With UniToEats, it will be possible for students to place orders without waiting in line, and to specify a certain pick up time that works with their schedules.
